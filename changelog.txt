[B]Retrospect v5.5.0 - Changelog - 2021-12-29[/B]

This new minor version introduces the option to create 'shortcuts' for videos and folders. These shortcuts are simple named items that can be used in Kodi (JSON) API calls without the need of specifying any guids that usually belong to Retrospect urls. More information can be found in the readme.md file under to section "Automation of Retrospect".

Besides this change, some channels were fixed.
